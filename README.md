### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Aikar. Been around the block in open source for a long time bouncing between a few game projects. Most of my focus is in Minecraft for the most recent years. Many in the developer community here should know me for my work on Paper (and previously Spigot), working to improve the server performance.

My specialty is in performance optimizations, but also DEATH TO BOILERPLATE software libraries.
